# CapacitiveSensorProject
Capacitive sensing is a technology that detects changes in capacitance to sense touch or proximity.
# Make a Basic Capacitive Sensor for an Arduino Board with Electric Paint

Objective:
The goal of this tutorial is to learn how to build a capacitive sensor that detects touch and proximity. This sensor will allow you to interact with your project in new ways, such as by sensing your hand’s approach or touch.

# Materials Needed:
1 x Electric Paint (10ml) – Acts as the sensor surface.
1 x Arduino Uno (or equivalent) – The main microcontroller.
1 x USB Cable – For connecting the Arduino to a computer.
1 x 2MΩ Resistor – For setting the sensitivity (adjustable).
